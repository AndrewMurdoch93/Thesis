\caption[Testing results of agents with various maximum speeds]{Testing results of agents with maximum longitudinal velocities ranging from $5$ m/s to $8$ m/s. Each row represents three agents trained with identical parameters, and tested for $100$ episodes each. The agents were tested under conditions identical to their training conditions, except that no exploration noise was added to their actions.}
